"""
backend/demo_seed.py — Demonstration file for the bundled demo client
====================================================================
A freshly cloned vault starts with an empty chain, so every screen renders as an
empty state — the running application looks broken rather than idle.

This module writes a small, clinically coherent therapy file for the demo client
(a CBT course for anxiety) so a first run shows the system doing its job. It only
ever runs alongside the demo accounts (development or VHV_DEMO_MODE), and only
when the client has no records yet, so it can never touch a real deployment or
overwrite a real chain.
