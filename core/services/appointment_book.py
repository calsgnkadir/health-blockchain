"""
core/services/appointment_book.py — a practitioner's appointment book
=====================================================================
Scheduling facts only: who (client ID), with whom (practitioner), when, for
how long, in person or online, and whether it happened. There is deliberately
no free-text field, so clinical content cannot end up in this unencrypted
table by accident. That a client sees a psychologist at all is still
sensitive, so every read is scoped to one practitioner's book or one client.

Who may use a book:
  * the practitioner who owns it;
  * a secretary linked to that practitioner (table practice_staff) — they run
    the book but never see a record: the access policy knows no "secretary"
    role, so every record endpoint refuses them;
  * a client, for their own appointments only (read, and cancel).

Rules:
  * a practitioner cannot be double-booked (scheduled appointments of the same
    practitioner never overlap);
  * a new or moved appointment starts in the future and lasts 15-240 minutes;
  * only a scheduled appointment can be moved or cancelled, and it can only be
    marked completed / no-show once it has started.

Single node (ADR-0002): the overlap check and the insert run on one
connection, one after the other, which is enough without concurrent workers.
