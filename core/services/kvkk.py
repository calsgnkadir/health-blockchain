"""
core/services/kvkk.py — the client's KVKK rights, in the product
================================================================
Three things a client can do without writing to the practice:

  * read the privacy notice (aydınlatma metni) and give explicit consent — the
    accepted version and the time are recorded;
  * download a copy of their own data (KVKK Art. 11);
  * ask for their data to be erased. The request does not erase anything by
    itself: an operator carries it out with the crypto-shred, which needs a
    dual-control co-signature, and only then can the request be closed as done.

The notice below is a template. A practice replaces it with its own text and
bumps NOTICE_VERSION, which asks every client to accept the new version.

    "practitioner add. Records of your therapy are health data, a special category of personal "
    "data under KVKK Art. 6.\n\n"
    "Why: to provide and document psychological counselling, to schedule sessions and to invoice them.\n\n"
    "How it is protected: records are encrypted, your practitioner sees only what you consent to, "
    "every access is logged and you can see who looked at your records.\n\n"
    "Who else sees it: nobody outside the practice. Operators of the system cannot read your records "
    "without a second person's approval, and the data is kept in Türkiye.\n\n"
    "Your rights (KVKK Art. 11): to know what is processed, to get a copy (\"Download my data\"), to "
